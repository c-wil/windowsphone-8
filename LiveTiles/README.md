# Project Description
This project demonstrates how to create a pinned tile on a Windows Phone 8 device using 
a custom live tile control. For this example, the custom control 
sets the background of a tile using a BitmapImage with an opacity 
mask. It also sets the text of the tile. 

# How To Install
Add the LiveTiles project folder to your computer and open the LiveTiles.sln file within the project folder. 
Build and run the project on either a Windows Phone 8 emulator or a Windows Phone 8 device.

# Usage
When the app has started, select a background, enter some text in the text box and tap the pin button.

# Disclaimer
You must have the Windows Phone 8 SDK installed on your PC and Visual Studio 2012 to run this project.
